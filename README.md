# UnBeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe
Nothing Too much to say about Tic-Tac-Toe, you already know it :)

Still Instruction is mentioned in [Manual Docs](https://github.com/manipta/UnBeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/baadf019b556d4c373d472009a1474ba06e1cbf6/Manual-Tic-Tac-Toe.pdf)

Thing to know about is the code!!
# Coding Section
We made this Project by using two very simple AI Algorithms:

***1. Minimax Algorithm*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***2. Alpha-Beta Pruning***

- ***Minimax Algorithm***

Minimax is a recursive algorithm which is used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. Its objective is to minimize the maximum loss. This algorithm is based on adversarial search technique.

- ***Alpha-Beta Pruning***

It is used to tackle large State Space Search. It Eliminates whole path of a node of Space Search if it does not go to the goal state.

Again the More Details of the Project is mentioned in [Manual Docs](https://github.com/manipta/UnBeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/baadf019b556d4c373d472009a1474ba06e1cbf6/Manual-Tic-Tac-Toe.pdf)

# Limitations/Future Work
- A GUI for the Game
- Scoring System
